				<br>
			<aside><p class="chakra">Chakra (cakra in Sanskrit) means <b>“wheel”</b> and refers to energy points in your body.
				<br><br>
			The seven chakras are the main energy centers of the body.
				<br><br>
			You've probably heard people talk about "unblocking" their chakras, which refers to the idea that when all of our chakras are open, energy can run through them freely, and harmony exists between the physical body, mind, and spirit.</p>

		<!--Root Chakra-->
		<section class="paragraph">
			<h3 id="sub-heading">Root Chakra <i>(Muladhara)</i></h3>
			<p>The <u>Muladhara</u>, or root chakra, represents our foundation. On the human body, it sits at the base of the spine and gives us the feeling of being grounded.
				<br>
			When the root chakra is open, we feel confident in our ability to withstand challenges and stand on our own two feet. When it's blocked, we feel threatened, as if we're standing on unstable ground.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Location:</strong> Base of Spine, in tailbone area</li>
				<li><strong>Mantra:</strong> "I can't grow from an unsteady foundation."</li>
				<li><strong>Color:</strong> Red</li>
				<li><strong>Element:</strong> Earth</li>
				<li><strong>Crystal:</strong> Red Jasper</li>
			</ul>
			
			<aside id="items">
				<p>Red Jasper enhances your physical strength, endurance and stamina. It activates your sexual and creative energies. It helps to release guilt and shame, and also helps you to feel safe expressing yourself.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<cite>"I am a child of the Earth and I belong here."<br>

		<!--Sacral Chakra-->
			<h3 id="sub-heading">Sacral Chakra <i>(Swadhisthana)</i></h3>
			<p>The <u>Swadhisthana</u>, or sacral chakra, helps inform how we relate to our emotions and the emotions of others. It also governs creativity and sexual energy. 
				<br>
			When your sacral chakra is opening, you are just starting to fully access and embody your true divine nature, being the creator of your life experiences. Those with a blocked sacral chakra could feel a lack of control in their lives. </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Location:</strong> Lower abdomen, about 2 inches below the navel</li>
				<li><strong>Mantra:</strong> "I always honor others but not before myself."</li>
				<li><strong>Color:</strong> Orange</li>
				<li><strong>Element:</strong> Water</li>
				<li><strong>Crystal:</strong> Carnelian</li>

		<!--Solar Plexus Chakra-->
			<h3 id="sub-heading">Solar Plexus Chakra <i>(Manipura)</i></h3>
			<p>The third chakra, the solar plexus chakra, speaks to your ability to be confident and in control of your life. Think back to the last time you had butterflies or felt a pit in the stomach: That's the <u>Manipura</u> chakra at work.
				<br>
			If your solar plexus chakra is blocked, you might feel overwhelming amounts of shame and self-doubt. Those with open sacral chakras are free to express their true selves.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Location:</strong> Upper abdomen in the stomach area</li>
				<li><strong>Mantra:</strong> "Self-love starts when I accept all parts of myself."</li>
				<li><strong>Color:</strong> Yellow</li>

				alt="Tiger Eye's stones from Amazon">

		<!--Heart Chakra-->
			<h3 id="sub-heading">Heart Chakra<i> (Anahata)</i></h3>
			<p>The <u>Anahata</u>, or heart chakra, is the bridge between the lower chakras (associated with materiality) and the upper chakras (associated with spirituality). As the name suggests, this chakra can influence our ability to give and receive love—from others and ourselves.
				<br>
			Someone with a blocked heart chakra will have difficulty fully opening up to the people in their life. If someone's heart is open, they can experience deep compassion and empathy.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Location:</strong> Center of chest, just above the heart</li>
				<li><strong>Mantra:</strong>  "When I love myself, loving others comes easily."</li>
				<li><strong>Color:</strong> Green</li>
				<li><strong>Element:</strong> Air</li>
				<li><strong>Crystal:</strong> Aventurine</li>
			</ul>

		<!--Throat Chakra-->
			<h3 id="sub-heading">Throat Chakra<i> (Vishuddha)</i></h3>
			<p>The <u>Vishuddha</u>, or throat chakra, gives voice to the heart chakra and controls our ability to communicate our personal power.<br>
			When it's functioning at full capacity, it allows us to express ourselves truly and clearly. Someone with a blocked throat chakra will feel like they have trouble finding the words to say how they truly feel.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Location:</strong> Throat</li>
				<li><strong>Mantra:</strong> "I speak my truth, always."</li>
				<li><strong>Color:</strong> Light Blue/Turquoise</li>
				<li><strong>Element:</strong> Sound/Music</li>
				<li><strong>Crystal:</strong> Aquamarine</li>
			</ul>
			<aside id="items">
				<p>Aquamarine helps you to slow down, get calm and be present in the moment. A beautiful crystal, that activates the throat chakra, connects you with your inner wisdom and gently brings you back to the truth of who you are. It helps you tap into and speak your truth with confidence.</p>

		<!--Third-Eye Chakra-->
			<h3 id="sub-heading">Third-Eye Chakra<i> (Ajna)</i></h3>
			<p>As we move up the body, we're getting closer to communion with the divine. The <u>Anja</u>, or third-eye chakra, controls our ability to see the big picture and connect to intuition. Think of it as the eye of the soul: It registers information beyond the surface level.<br>
			Visions and intuitive hits are not uncommon for someone with an open third-eye chakra.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Location:</strong> Forehead between the eyes</li>
				<li><strong>Mantra:</strong> "I am open to exploring what cannot be seen."</li>
				<li><strong>Color:</strong> Dark Blue/Purple</li>
				<li><strong>Element:</strong> Light</li>
				<li><strong>Crystal:</strong> Amethyst</li>
			</ul>
			<aside id="items">

		<!--Crown Chakra-->
			<h3 id="sub-heading">Crown Chakra<i> (Sahasrara)</i></h3>
			<p>The <u>Sahasrara</u>, or crown chakra, the highest chakra, sits at the crown of the head and represents our ability to be fully connected spiritually. When you fully open your crown chakra—something very few people ever do!—you're able to access a higher consciousness.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Location:</strong> The very top of the head</li>
				<li><strong>Mantra:</strong> "I am a vessel for love and light."</li>
				<li><strong>Color:</strong> Violet/White</li>
				<li><strong>Element:</strong> Divine Consciousness</li>
				<li><strong>Crystal:</strong> Clear quartz</li>
			</ul>
			<aside id="items">
